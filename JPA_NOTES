FETCH RULES

	One to one by default fetches EAGER
	One to Many by default fetches LAZY
	Many to Many by default fetches LAZY

One needs to be careful about the way cascade is defined

In this example, email groups need to be independent. So they should define the mapped by column in many to many relationship

And the definition of join tables and columns need to be in Employee

The one to one relationship doesnt by default remove when the other entity is removed
In many to many relationship, the default is to remove
And in one to many relationship the cascase needs to be defined.

In this schenario, the cascade needs to be defined to paystubs
